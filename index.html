          <div class="introtext">
          <p>I used to be a lonely house, crouching in the Apalachian mountains behind unremarkable set of thorny bushes and lean cypress trees. 
            Now I have decided to walk down the Valley of Men and become a sanctified servant of ancient knowledge. I decided to be the thesaurus, last bastion of 
        moustached structures of human creation. Please rest your troubled psyche patiently on the sofa and open your minds.</p>

            <h3>Extreme surrealism</h3>
            <p>I have 6 years of experience in being unable to write a coherent, serious piece of text. Great management and organizational skills and am succulent a Steam Player. The age of steam locomotives was long over, however the white collar of priests still shone unstained in the rays of a dying dawn, somewhere on a Bayou.</p>

            <h3>I can withstand moderate Dolor</h3>
            <p>For more than 63 hours the pain in my ear lobe won't recede, after being hit by a boxing glove during a friendly sparring. Body retention level: recognizable. It is what objectively fulfills the role of a engaging think-tank pull-over shirt with over-the-top, hands-on skillset of jugular bloodletting.</p>

            <p>But those days are gone, it's all seemingly a game, dance, act, drama of life directed by: The <span class="pro">WHOLLY</span> yetti. And his cronies. Those subjects are reportedly seen in the vicinity of your entrance and vestibule.</p>
